Margherita Issues & Bugs
------------------------

12101805: Double CSS stylesheets! [bug]
          Rails is including every single stylesheet per file and
          as a merged global application.css. Dunno why.

12101804: Categories view [issue]
          Right border of the <li> element is not displayed. Should be width problem.

12101803: Products layout [issue]
          Products list in '/products' should be divided into categories.

12101802: Sign in redirect [issue]
          Redirect target should depend on the page/situation we are signing in from.
          1. The 'sign in modal' called by the 'Shipping info' button should be
             closed and redirect to 'orders/new' after successful signing in.
          2. Signin in from the 'sessions/new' should redirect to orders history (?)

12101801: Sign in modal [issue]
          Entering invalid password closes modal & redirects to sign in page,
          instead of staying in modal and displaying 'sign-in error' msg.
